## Introduction

I started experimenting with c++ a day ago and it was intersting idea to try how would a desktop app look like in C++ and that's how I ended up trying things with Qt which was really fun to explore and catchy

## About the App

This app allows users to estimate their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) based on various input parameters such as gender, body weight, hours since the last drink, alcohol volume, and alcohol content. The app takes these inputs and performs calculations to provide an estimated BAC value, which indicates the level of alcohol in the user's bloodstream.
